  "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq_subtitle": "Useful details for recruiters.",
  "faq_q_about": "Tell me about yourself.",
  "faq_a_about": "<p>I'm a strategic technology leader who gets results by bridging the gap between technical possibilities and business goals. I thrive on making complex technology simple and delivering measurable value, whether that's through financial governance, robust security architecture, or building empowered, high-performing teams.</p>",
  "faq_q_standout": "What makes you stand out?",
  "faq_a_standout": "<p>My ability to operate at both the 30,000-foot strategic level and the 3-foot delivery level. I can architect a multi-year Zero Trust strategy and, in the same day, work with my engineering team to unblock a critical Terraform script. This blend of executive vision and deep technical credibility allows me to lead effectively and earn the trust of both the boardroom and the server room.</p>",
  "faq_q_strengths": "What are your key strengths and areas for improvement?",
  "faq_a_strengths": "<p>My key strength is strategic problem-solving‚ÄîI excel at untangling complex technical and business challenges and creating a clear, actionable path forward. An area I'm actively focused on improving is delegation; with my hands-on background, my instinct is often to jump in and help solve a problem directly. I'm consciously working on stepping back more, empowering my team to find the solution, and focusing my energy on the higher-level strategic blockers only I can solve.</p>",
  "faq_q_motivates": "What motivates you?",
  "faq_a_motivates": "<p>I'm motivated by tangible impact. I love the challenge of taking a chaotic system or a vague business problem and creating an elegant, efficient, and secure solution that makes people's jobs easier and saves the organization money. Seeing my team succeed and grow their skills is also a huge driver for me. The main challenge is always balancing urgent, tactical needs with long-term strategic goals, which is a puzzle I enjoy solving.</p>",
  "faq1_q": "What are your salary expectations?",
  "faq1_a": "<p>My compensation reflects a senior leadership role in London public sector. The package is negotiable based on total compensation and performance-based elements.</p>",
  "faq2_q": "What is your notice period and location preference?",
  "faq2_a": "<p>My notice period is three months. I am UK-based and prefer remote or hybrid roles.</p>",
  "faq4_q": "Why did the sysadmin cross the road?",
  "faq4_a": "<p>To get to the other site. üòÇ</p>",
  "faq3_q": "Random fact?",
  "faq3_a": "<p>The first recorded computer ‚Äúbug‚Äù was a moth found in a relay of the Mark II in 1947. üêõ</p>",
